## Name
IndustryProject: Stolpersteine.

## Link
https://git.fhict.nl/I540047/industryproject.git

## Description
This is a new app made for PWA, this app shows the locations of all Stolpersteine on a map and you can take a picture which will alter the database. We also hope to get an API from oorlogsbronnen.nl with all information about WOII victims but for now it is hard coded, we also implemented a narrator feature which will speak the information for the user out loud with AI from Eleven Labs.

## Project status
Incomplete.

## Code status
Incomplete. Has to be made PWA, problems with camera.
