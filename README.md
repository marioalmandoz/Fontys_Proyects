## Description
For the IndustryProject we had to make an Stolpersteine app 1 native and 1 hybrid. In this git repo we have made the PWA. The app has a narrator feature, that is gonna tell the user the story about the victim. We also made map where you can see the Stolpersteine nearby on the map. When clicked on the marker the user can choose if they want to learn more about the victim or they can choose to take a picture of the Stolpersteine. When a picture is taken the geolocation of that stone is saved and altered in the database. So that the stones are found on the exact location on the map.

## Project status
Complete.

## Code status
Complete. 
We used google voice in the code but we also have the Eleven Labs in there for usage, because the free version as a limited amount of words we can use, otherwise it doesn't speak. That is the reason we now have google voice enabled.
