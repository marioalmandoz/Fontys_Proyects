My parents, Max and Hilde Loewenstein, sought refuge in Eindhoven in 1934, where my father ran a shoe store on Demer 39. Life above the store held simple joys until December 1942, when bombing razed the Demer, including our home. In the aftermath, my father went into hiding but was captured and sent to Westerbork on March 31, 1943. From there, Auschwitz became his grim destination on August 24, 1943, sealing his fate during the wandering period on May 31, 1945. As the chaos unfolded, my mother, younger brother Rolf, and I sought sanctuary in Maarheeze. However, the cries of my brother deemed us a risk, leading to our separation. Rolf found refuge with Farmer Pol in Apeldoorn, while I, at the age of eight, faced a harsher fate at the hands of the Germans. On November 4, 1943, I was taken to Westerbork, a stepping stone to Auschwitz on November 16, 1943. The cold reality awaited me on November 19, 1943, as I, like countless others, perished upon arrival. My mother Hilde and brother Rolf were among the fortunate ones who survived the war, spared the horrors that befell me. Today, I am a name etched in the somber history of those tumultuous times, a reminder that in the face of darkness, some stories remain too painful to forget.')"
